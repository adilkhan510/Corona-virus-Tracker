Live Project can found here :  https://covid-19----tracker.herokuapp.com/

I created this project to get more practice in working with react hooks and material-ui. I also didn't find any apps that were dynamically showing the data for each country so I figured I should build it myself. 
In the pictures below you can see how the app operates.
User stories :
  1. User arrives at the page, they see dummy data, and a button that opens up a menu that shows the countries that are available to select from. In this case there are about 199 countries to select from.
  2. User selects a country and data and chart for that country pops up.

Stack Used : 
  1. Node
  2. React
  3. JavaScript
  4. Material-ui
